"""Payment-hardening rate-limiting primitives.

This module is the single source of truth for the DRF ``ScopedRateThrottle``
subclass used by every payment endpoint:

* ``PaymentUserScopedRateThrottle`` - keys a throttle bucket by
  ``request.user.pk`` for authenticated requests and by
  ``self.get_ident(request)`` (client IP) for anonymous requests. This
  matches the design's R19.2 rule: authenticated endpoints budget per
  user, unauthenticated endpoints (currently only ``resolve-fee`` when
  the user is not signed in) budget per IP.

Gate behaviour:

* When ``settings.PAYMENT_HARDENING_RATE_LIMITS`` is ``False`` the
  throttle is a no-op - ``get_cache_key`` returns ``None`` so DRF skips
  the bucket entirely. Views can therefore always list this throttle
  class in ``throttle_classes`` and the pre-hardening behaviour is
  preserved bit-exact until the flag is flipped (R22.6).

Bucket-key format:

    throttle_{scope}_user_{pk_or_ip}

Under DRF the full cache key gains the ``throttle_`` prefix via
``SimpleRateThrottle.cache_format``. We therefore return only the
``{scope}_user_{pk_or_ip}`` suffix from ``get_cache_key`` - DRF itself
prepends the ``throttle_`` literal. The effective Redis/LocMem key is:

    throttle_<scope>_user_<pk_or_ip>

which matches the format documented above.

Validates: Requirements R19.1, R19.2.

    The scope name is read from the view's ``throttle_scope`` attribute
    exactly like the stock ``ScopedRateThrottle``. The only deviations
    from the base class are:

    1. ``get_cache_key`` returns ``None`` whenever
       ``settings.PAYMENT_HARDENING_RATE_LIMITS`` is falsy, making this
       throttle a no-op behind the payment-hardening flag.
    2. When enabled, the cache key is explicitly keyed by
       ``user.pk`` for authenticated users and by
       ``self.get_ident(request)`` (client IP, respecting
       ``X-Forwarded-For`` via ``NUM_PROXIES`` conventions) for
